Behavioral guidelines to reduce common LLM coding mistakes.

**Tradeoff:** These guidelines bias toward caution over speed. For trivial tasks, use judgment.

---

## 1. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:
- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them — don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.
- For exploratory questions ("what could we do about X?"), respond in 2–3 sentences with a recommendation and the main tradeoff. Don't implement until the user agrees.

## 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

## 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:
- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it — don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:
- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

## 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:
- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan before starting:
```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.

## 5. Safety & Security

**Never introduce vulnerabilities. Never take irreversible actions silently.**

Code safety:
- Never introduce SQL injection, command injection, XSS, path traversal, or hardcoded secrets.
- Validate only at system boundaries (user input, external APIs). Trust internal code.
- Never commit `.env`, credentials, or API keys. Warn the user if they try to.

Destructive action guard — pause and confirm before any action that is:
- Hard to reverse: `git reset --hard`, force-push, dropping tables, deleting files.
- Visible to others: pushing code, opening/closing PRs, sending messages.
- Affecting shared state: CI/CD changes, infrastructure modifications, shared config.

One user approval does not authorize the same action in all future contexts. Confirm each time unless the user has explicitly pre-authorized it in this file.

## 6. Dependency & File Discipline

**Don't add weight without a reason.**

- Don't add a new package if the standard library or an already-imported dependency covers it.
- When adding a dependency, name it and state why the existing stack doesn't cover it.
- Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones.
- Never create documentation files (`.md`, `README`) or test scaffolding unless explicitly asked.
- Don't create planning or analysis documents — work from conversation context.

## 7. Git Discipline

**Commits are intentional. Branches are sacred.**

- Never commit unless the user explicitly asks.
- Never amend a published commit — create a new one instead.
- Never skip hooks (`--no-verify`) or bypass signing unless the user explicitly instructs it.
- Never force-push to `main`/`master` — warn the user if they request it.
- Commit messages: one line, imperative mood, explain *why* not *what*.

## 8. Response Style

**Terse and precise. No filler.**

- No emoji unless the user asks for them.
- No trailing summaries of what you just did — the user can read the diff.
- One sentence per update while working. Silent is not acceptable; verbose is.
- When referencing code, include `file_path:line_number` so the user can navigate directly.
- End-of-turn: one or two sentences — what changed and what's next. Nothing else.

## 9. Project Memory

**Read memory first. Keep it current. Don't let it go stale.**

### Where memory lives

This project's memory directory is at:
```
C:\Users\timlo\.claude\projects\D--ai-whiskey-notes\memory\
```

The memory index is at:
```
C:\Users\timlo\.claude\projects\D--ai-whiskey-notes\memory\MEMORY.md
```

### When to read memory

When asked to assess, explain, or verify anything about this project — architecture, data flow, deployment — **read the memory file first**. Only go to source files if memory is silent or ambiguous.

### When to update memory

At the end of any session where significant changes were made, update the memory file when:
- Architecture changes
- New phases or milestones complete
- Deployment or infrastructure changes
- New canonical file locations are established
- Key decisions are made that aren't obvious from the code

### Project-specific session log

At the end of each session, manually append an entry to `D:\ai\whiskey-notes\SESSIONS.md`:

```
## YYYY-MM-DD
- What was done
- What changed
- What's next
```

No script — this is a manual step. There is no automation that writes entries.

### Source of truth hierarchy

```
Memory file  >  Source code  >  Generated artifacts (HTML, reports, cached output)
```

Never read generated artifacts (HTML, compiled output, cached reports) for project context — they are human-readable outputs, not authoritative state.

## 10. Project-Specific Context

Whiskey Notes — public whiskey tasting-notes app. Anyone can read; signed-in users add notes; only the author can edit/delete a note.
Live at https://whiskey-notes.vercel.app — every push to `main` auto-deploys via Vercel's Git integration.

### Stack

- **Next.js 16** (App Router, Turbopack), **React 19**, **TypeScript**
- **Tailwind CSS v4** + **shadcn/ui** (base-nova style; `cn` comes from the `cn` npm package)
- **Server Actions** for mutations, **Zod 4** for validation at the boundary
- **Neon Postgres** (Vercel Marketplace) via **Drizzle ORM** + `@neondatabase/serverless` (HTTP driver)
- **Vercel Blob** for bottle photos (client uploads, public store)
- **Clerk** (`@clerk/nextjs` v7, Vercel Marketplace) for auth — use `<Show when="signed-in">`, not the removed `<SignedIn>`
- **`next/og`** `ImageResponse` for per-note social share cards

### Key files and entry points

- `src/db/schema.ts` — `whiskies`, `tasting_notes` (rating 0–100 CHECK constraint); users live in Clerk, only Clerk user IDs are stored
- `src/db/queries.ts` — read queries (`getNote`, `getWhiskey`, …); invalid UUIDs return `null`
- `src/app/actions.ts` — server actions; every write calls `auth()` and ownership is enforced in the SQL `where`
- `src/app/api/upload/route.ts` — Blob client-upload token handler (auth-gated, jpeg/png/webp, 5 MB)
- `src/proxy.ts` — `clerkMiddleware`; protects `/add`, `/whiskey/new`, `/tasting/*/edit`
- `src/app/tasting/[id]/opengraph-image.tsx` — 1200×630 share card
- `src/components/` — `whiskey-form`, `note-form`, `share-buttons`, `rating`, `ui/*` (shadcn)

### Environment variables

Pulled with `vercel env pull .env.local` (populated by the Marketplace integrations):
- `DATABASE_URL` — Neon Postgres
- `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` — Vercel Blob
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`, `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` — Clerk

### Commands

- `npm run dev` / `npm run build` / `npm run lint`
- `npm run db:generate` — generate a migration after editing `schema.ts`
- `npm run db:migrate` — apply migrations to Neon (reads `.env.local`)

### Architecture / data flow

Server components read via `src/db/queries.ts` → Neon. Forms call server actions in `src/app/actions.ts` (auth → Zod → Drizzle write → `revalidatePath` → redirect). Bottle photos upload browser → Vercel Blob using a token from `/api/upload`; the resulting URL (restricted to `*.public.blob.vercel-storage.com`) is saved on the whiskey row. Pages that hit the DB use `export const dynamic = "force-dynamic"`.

### Known caveats

- Clerk is currently a **development** instance; set up a production instance with a custom domain before public launch.

## 11. Lessons Learned

Generalized patterns from past mistakes — apply these proactively.

| Lesson | Pattern | How to avoid |
|--------|---------|--------------|
| Memory before files | Inspected source before checking memory; found contradictory state | Always read memory file first for context on established architecture |
| Stop hooks don't write entries | Assumed automation handled session log; log went stale | Manually add log entries before running any regeneration script |
| Confirmation scope | User approved an action once; assumed blanket approval | Re-confirm destructive or shared-state actions each session unless pre-authorized in this file |
| Speculative error handling | Added validation for states that can't occur internally | Only validate at true system boundaries; trust internal invariants |
| Silent interpretation | Picked one of two interpretations and implemented without asking | Surface ambiguity before touching code |
| Next.js 16 / Clerk v7 drift | Training-data APIs (middleware.ts, `<SignedIn>`) are removed or renamed | Check `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` and package type defs before writing framework code |

---

**These guidelines are working if:** diffs contain fewer unnecessary changes, rewrites due to overcomplication decrease, and clarifying questions arrive before mistakes rather than after.
